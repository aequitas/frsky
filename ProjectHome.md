The aim is to have a display on which the values received by the FrSky Telemetry module are displayed.
Further the alarm-setting of the FrSky TX-Module should be configured by the user without the need of PC.

Final goal is to implement the results in the TH9X FW so the
values can be displayed on the TH9X display and alarm thresholds con be configured via the TH9X.

The project is just starting.<br>
Anyone interested can join.<br>
We plan on developing the SW for different platforms.<br>
I will add source code for Atmega at90usb162 - since that is the development platform which i am using. It is available for 10â‚¬ only and can be easily programed via USB. Perfect for rapid prototyping.<br>

Display is currently a 4x16 LCD.<br>
Eagle files for the breakout between estick and LCD available.<br>
Only a few components needed: Max232 (+ ext. components) - Potentiometer - Rotary Encoder.<br>
Using the Rotary Encoder with button function it shall allow to program the alarm levels<br>
in the TX Module.
